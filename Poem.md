>A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
>It's loveliness increases; it will never
>Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
>A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
>Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
>Therefire, on every morrow, are we wreathing
>A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
>Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
>Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
>Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
