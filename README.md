# hello-world
This is just the beginning.

Hello, my name is Ian Lockhart- but you can call me Nismo or Voodood if you'd prefer. I am an OH native living in CO at the time of writing. My interests include computers, exploring consciousness, live music (mostly EDM- Bassnectar in particular), and gaming (mostly Dota 2). I also enjoy playing with animals, traveling, and reading with science fiction / fantasy being my prefered genre. I have one younger sister, and most of my immediate family lives in OH. I absolutely love seafood and am hoping to be able to backpack through Asia sooner rather than later- hopefully in 2019!
